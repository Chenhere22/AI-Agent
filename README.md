# 1. Target Market Segmentation

Core User Groups
Audience	Pain Points & Needs	Willingness to Pay
Chinese in Germany	Urgent need to master daily/work communication (visa appointments, complaints, job interviews) with instant feedback and cultural guidance.	High (critical need)
Pre-departure Learners	Pre-Germany crash training for real-life scenarios (renting, banking, shopping) to avoid "textbook German."	Medium
German Teachers	Demand for AI tools to automate homework grading and reduce teaching workload.	Medium (B2B)
Corporate Expats	Specialized training for business contexts (meetings, email etiquette, cross-cultural communication).	High (corporate budgets)
Competitor Weaknesses & Your Edge
Busuu/Duolingo: Generic content, lacking Germany-specific scenarios (e.g., handling landlord negotiations).

italki: High cost for live tutors (€25–50/hour), no on-demand practice.

## Our Differentiation:

Hyper-localized Scenarios: Focus on high-frequency, essential scenarios for Chinese residents in Germany (e.g., "health insurance reimbursement").

Cultural Intelligence: Teach unspoken rules (e.g., avoiding direct "Nein" in favor of "Leider nein").

## Development Roadmap (6 Months)
Phase 1 (MVP): 10 core scenarios (supermarket returns, visa interviews, self-introductions) + basic grammar/pronunciation checks.

Phase 2: Cultural nuance alerts (e.g., "This phrase is polite in Berlin but rude in Munich") + user-generated scenarios (e.g., "How to argue a failed exam").

Phase 3: AR-enhanced training (e.g., scanning a fridge triggers "grocery shopping" dialogue) + enterprise modules (e.g., e-commerce客服 training).
